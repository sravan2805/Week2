                <h3>Reviewer 1</h3>
                <p>First of all, this is a must-watch movie for all movie lovers. Below is a more detailed review:
                    The very first scene itself is a glimpse of the clash between Abhimanyu and Ghatothkach that creates curiosity among viewers.
                    Then comes the age attaining function of Shahsirekha, where they have shown the girl in a perfect way where she still has childish behavior and is slowly entering adulthood.
                    NTR has rocked the screen in depicting how calm and composed Sri Krishna was.
                    Balaram teases his wife with the bow in her hand which is funnily romantic!! 
                    Coming to the main role, Ghatothkach's role has come out awesome. The way he walks, his humor sense, his anger towards Kauravas, his strength and capacity, etc all have been shown in excellent ways. The song "Vivaha Bhojanambu" is evergreen and all kids, elders, and even old age people love it even today. 
                    
                    The comedy where Uttarakumara's hands get stuck is so hilarious.
                    Savitri has done an excellent part in depicting how Ghatothkach would behave in disguise as a girl. "Aha naa pelli anta" song is so so good. This movie has excellent songs, the best comedy, extraordinary graphics, awesome dialog, and a fantastic screenplay. Please do watch with family and have a perfect time.</p>
